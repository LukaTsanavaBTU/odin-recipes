    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I made this up one day when I couldn't find a recipe anywhere with these ingredients. So I kind of threw it together on a whim. Sugar can be adjusted for sweetness, and if the sauce gets a bit thicker than desired I suggest adding a little chicken broth as it's thickening. Serve immediately over rice.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Polish sauce</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Green bell pepper</li>
        <li>Pineapple</li>
        <li>Cornstarch</li>
        <li>Pineapple juice</li>
        <li>Brown sugar</li>
        <li>Cider vinegar</li>
        <li>Soy sauce</li>
        <li>Minced garlic</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Step 1</strong>
            <p>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir sausage, onion, and green bell pepper until vegetables start to become tender, about 8 minutes; add pineapple and cook, stirring occasionally, until the pineapple is hot, about 5 minutes more.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Step 2</strong>
            <p>Beat pineapple juice and cornstarch together in a bowl using a whisk. Stir brown sugar, cider vinegar, soy sauce, and minced garlic with the pineapple juice until the sugar dissolves into the liquid; pour over the sausage mixture and cook until the sauce thickens, 5 to 8 minutes.</p>
